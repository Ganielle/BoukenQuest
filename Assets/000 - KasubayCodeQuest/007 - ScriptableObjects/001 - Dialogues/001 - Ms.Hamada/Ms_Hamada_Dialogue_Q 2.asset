  - Hello, Ms. Hamada. My name is Haru. I need some help figuring out how to return
    to my world. Can you assist me?
  - Hello, Haru. I understand. To help you, I need you to retrieve a specific item
    from the storage room on the second floor next to the comfort rooms.
  - What item should I retrieve, and how will this help me return home?
  - The item is a small box labeled <color="green">"Return Key."</color> Once you
    have it, bring it to my office. It will help us determine the next steps for
    your return.
  - "Got it. What should I do once I\u2019ve retrieved the item?"
  - "Come to my office and let me know when you\u2019ve brought the item."
  - "Thank you, Ms. Hamada. I\u2019ll get the item and come to see you."
  - Thank you, Haru. I look forward to hearing from you.
